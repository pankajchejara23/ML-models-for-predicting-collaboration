# Predicting collaboration in students using machine learning

This repository contains machine learning codes and data pre-processing scripts used in my second article of Phd. This article is focused on building collaboration predictive models using multimodal data, e.g., audio, video, logs.

Following files/directories are stored in the repository.

1. preprocessing_merge_videos_split_screen.py: This python script takes multiple videos which are stored at different point of time, and create a new video with split screen by synchronising them all.
